The codes are structered, in the Codes directory, as so:

1. select_counties analyzes all US counties and select those hit by the wildfire event and those used as control counties, as well as conveying other informations about the AQI index,
2. Figure_1 produces the mobility disruption figure,
3. Regression_discontinuity_code analyzes the disruption on the mobility index and produces an estimate of the shift,
4. Model_disruption simulates the effect of this behavioral pattern into an SIR model as well as the damping effect of mask usage.

The Data zipfile contains all the data needed to run the different codes.
