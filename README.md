This repository is associated with the research study:

"Disruption of outdoor activities caused by wildfires increases disease circulation"

Link: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.08.24311678

The Python scripts utilized in this study are organized in the Codes folder as follows:

1. select_counties.ipynb: analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) for all U.S. counties and identifies those affected and unaffected by the September 2020 wildfire event.
2. Figure_1.R : generates Figure 1 from the manuscript's main text.
3. Regression_Discontinuity_code.ipynb: quantify the disruption in indoor activities during the wildfires.
4. Model_disruption.ipynb: simulates using a SIR model the effect of seasonal indoor activity patterns and their disruptions, also accounting for the potential mitigating effects of mask usage. The code also generates Figure 2.  

All datasets used in the analysis are available in the Data folder.
