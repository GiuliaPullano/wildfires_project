This repository is associated with the research study:

"Disruption of outdoor activities caused by wildfires increases disease circulation"

Link: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.08.24311678

The Python scripts utilized in this study are organized in the Data folder as follows:

select_counties script: Analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) for all U.S. counties and identifies those affected and unaffected by the September 2020 wildfire event.
Figure_1 script: Generates Figure 1 from the manuscript's main text.
Regression_discontinuity script: Examines the disruption in mobility patterns and estimates the resulting behavioral shift.
Model_disruption script: Simulates the effect of seasonal indoor activity patterns and their disruptions within an SIR model, also accounting for the potential mitigating effects of mask usage.

All datasets used in the analysis are also available in the Data folder.
