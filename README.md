This repository is connected to the work titled 

"Disruption of outdoor activities caused by wildfire smoke shapes circulation of respiratory pathogens"
 
Link: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.08.24311678

The codes are in the Codes directory, as so:

1. select_counties code analyzes Air Quality Index for all US counties and selects those hit and not hit by the wildfire event in Sept 2020
2. Figure_1 code produces Figure 1 in the main text of the manuscript 
3. Regression_discontinuity_code analyzes the disruption on the mobility index and produces an estimate of the shift in behavior
4. Model_disruption code simulates the effect of this behavioral pattern into a SIR model as well as the damping effect of mask usage.

The Data folder contains all the data needed to run the different codes.
